This project involves buildinga system to automatically interpret emotional content of laughter can assist robot assistants in understanding various types of communication used by humans. 
For example, a chuckle may indicate that a human is content and that the robot is doing an adequate job of meeting the person's demands. However, the chuckle could also indicate that the robot made an unexpected error and is being mocked for how poorly it is serving the person. The emotional content of laughing might differentiate between two situations. 
It is with the goal of helping robot assistants derive inference about emotional content in laughter that we have undertaken this project.
